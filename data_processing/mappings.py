# Note: If two categories have overlapping keywords, the category listed first in the mappings dictionary will take precedence.
# Example: To debug, you can print a specific category's keywords using dict() or access them directly (e.g., print(FOOD)).


def mappings(data):
    """
    Categorizes input data based on predefined keywords for each category.

    Parameters:
    data (str): The input string to be categorized by matching keywords.

    Returns:
    str: The name of the matching category, or "ðŸ”–ðŸ”–ðŸ”–Misc" if no match is found.

    How it works:
    1. A dictionary `categories` maps category names to sets of keywords.
    2. The function checks if any keyword from each category is present in the input `data`.
    3. It returns the first matching category name. If no keywords match, it returns "ðŸ”–ðŸ”–ðŸ”–Misc".

    Example:
    If `FOOD = {"apple", "bread"}` and `GREENFOOD = {"spinach", "kale"}`, 
    calling `mappings("I bought some bread and spinach")` will return "FOOD".
